# Placeholder-Image-Generator

An image placeholder generator written in PHP.

To use, add the following to your img src.

nhampshire.com/images/?w=200&h=100

You can change the values of w and h to generate an image with a corresponding width and height.
If only a width is specified then a square image will be generated using that value.

The image on the right is being generated using this method.
